# building the images yourself

```bash
./make.sh hclean pull img push
```
will download the latest copyparty-sfx.py from github unless you have [built it from scratch](../../docs/devnotes.md#just-the-sfx) and then build all the images based on that

deprecated alternative: run `make` to use the makefile however that uses docker instead of podman and only builds x86_64

`make.sh` is necessarily(?) overengineered because:
* podman keeps burning dockerhub pulls by not using the cached images (`--pull=never` does not apply to manifests)
* podman cannot build from a local manifest, only local images or remote manifests

but I don't really know what i'm doing here ðŸ’©

* auth for pushing images to repos;  
  `podman login docker.io`  
  `podman login ghcr.io -u 9001`
