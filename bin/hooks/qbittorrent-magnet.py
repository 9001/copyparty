_ = r"""
start downloading a torrent by POSTing a magnet URL to copyparty,
for example using ðŸ“Ÿ (message-to-server-log) in the web-ui

by default it will download the torrent to the folder you were in
when you pasted the magnet into the message-to-server-log field

you can optionally specify another location by adding a whitespace
after the magnet URL followed by the name of the subfolder to DL into,
or for example "anime/airing" would download to /srv/media/anime/airing
because the keyword "anime" is in the DESTS config below

needs python3

example usage as global config (not a good idea):
    python copyparty-sfx.py --xm f,j,t60,bin/hooks/qbittorrent-magnet.py

parameters explained,
    xm = execute on message (ðŸ“Ÿ)
    f = fork; don't delay other hooks while this is running
    j = provide message information as json (not just the text)
    t60 = abort if qbittorrent has to think about it for more than 1 min

example usage as a volflag (per-volume config, much better):
    -v srv/qb:qb:A,ed:c,xm=f,j,t60,bin/hooks/qbittorrent-magnet.py
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    (share filesystem-path srv/qb as volume /qb with Admin for user 'ed',
     running this plugin on all messages with the params explained above)

example usage as a volflag in a copyparty config file:
    [/qb]
      srv/qb
      accs:
        A: ed
      flags:
        xm: f,j,t60,bin/hooks/qbittorrent-magnet.py

the volflag examples only kicks in if you send the torrent magnet
while you're in the /qb folder (or any folder below there)
