use copyparty as a dumb messaging server / guestbook thing;
initially contributed by @clach04 in https://github.com/9001/copyparty/issues/35 (thanks!)

Sample usage:

    python copyparty-sfx.py --xm j,bin/hooks/msg-log.py

Where:

    xm = execute on message-to-server-log
    j = provide message information as json; not just the text - this script REQUIRES json
    t10 = timeout and kill download after 10 secs

# note that this becomes very slow/expensive as the file gets bigger

# 'ap' = absolute filesystem path where the message was posted
# 'vp' = virtual path (URL 'path') where the message was posted
# 'mt' = 'at' = unix-timestamp when the message was posted
# 'datetime' = ISO-8601 time when the message was posted
# 'sz' = message size in bytes
# 'host' = the server hostname which the user was accessing (URL 'host')
# 'user' = username (if logged in), otherwise '*'
# 'txt' = the message text itself
# (uncomment the print(msg_info) to see if additional information has been introduced by copyparty since this was written)
