## current design

main
  tcpsrv
    httpsrv
    mpsrv
      mpworker
        httpsrv
          ...

##
## things which need the broker

moving uploaded files into place
creating a thumbnail

##
## thumbnails

two components:
  thumbcache is directly accessed by httpd to return pregenerated thumbnails
  thumbsrv is accessed through a broker on cache miss to generate and return

##
## initial ideas

need log interface
  tcpsrv creates it
  httpsrv must use interface

msgsvc
  simulates a multiprocessing queue
  takes events from httpsrv
    logging
  mpsrv pops queue and forwards to this

tcpsrv
  tcp listener
  pass tcp clients to worker
  api to get status messages from workers

mpsrv
  uses multiprocessing to handle incoming clients

httpsrv
  takes client sockets, starts threads
  takes argv acc/vol through init args
  loads acc/vol from config file
