# leave a blank line between volumes
# (and also between users and volumes)

# create a volume:
# share "." (the current directory)
# as "/" (the webroot) for the following users:
# "r" grants read-access for anyone
# "a ed" grants read-write to ed
.

a ed

# custom permissions for the "priv" folder:
# user "k" can see/read the contents
# and "ed" gets read-write access
./priv
/priv
r k
a ed

# share /home/ed/Music/ as /music and let anyone read it
# (this will replace any folder called "music" in the webroot)
/home/ed/Music
/music
r

# and a folder where anyone can upload
# but nobody can see the contents
/home/ed/inc
/dump
w

# this entire config file can be replaced with these arguments:
# -u ed:123 -u k:k -v .::r:aed -v priv:priv:rk:aed -v /home/ed/Music:music:r -v /home/ed/inc:dump:w
# but note that the config file always wins in case of conflicts
