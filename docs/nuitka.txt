# recipe for building an exe with nuitka (extreme jank edition)

NOTE: copyparty runs SLOWER when compiled with nuitka;
  just use copyparty-sfx.py and/or pyinstaller instead

  ( the sfx and the pyinstaller EXEs are equally fast if you
  have the latest jinja2 installed, but the older jinja that
  comes bundled with the sfx is slightly faster yet )

  roughly, copyparty-sfx.py is 6% faster than copyparty.exe
  (win10-pyinstaller), and copyparty.exe is 10% faster than
  nuitka, making copyparty-sfx.py 17% faster than nuitka

NOTE: every time a nuitka-compiled copyparty.exe is launched,
  it will show the windows firewall prompt since nuitka will
  pick a new unique location in %TEMP% to unpack an exe into,
  unlike pyinstaller which doesn't fork itself on startup...
  might be fixable by configuring nuitka differently, idk

NOTE: nuitka EXEs are larger than pyinstaller ones;
  a minimal nuitka build of just the sfx (with its bundled
  dependencies) was already the same size as the pyinstaller
  copyparty.exe which also includes Mutagen and Pillow

NOTE: nuitka takes a lot longer to build than pyinstaller
  (due to actual compilation of course, but still)

NOTE: binaries built with nuitka cannot run on windows7,
  even when compiled with python 3.6 on windows 7 itself

NOTE: `--python-flags=-m` is the magic sauce to
  correctly compile `from .util import Daemon`
  (which otherwise only explodes at runtime)

NOTE: `--deployment` doesn't seem to affect performance
