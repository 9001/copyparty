# custom fonts

to change the fonts in the web-UI,  first save the following text (the default font-config) to a new css file, for example named `customfonts.css` in your webroot:

```css
:root {
	--font-main: sans-serif;
	--font-serif: serif;
	--font-mono: 'scp';
}
```

add this to your copyparty config so the css file gets loaded: `--html-head='<link rel="stylesheet" href="/customfonts.css">'`

alternatively, if you are using a config file instead of commandline args:

```yaml
[global]
  html-head: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/customfonts.css">
```

restart copyparty for the config change to take effect

edit the css file you made and press `ctrl`-`shift`-`R` in the browser to see the changes as you go (no need to restart copyparty for each change)

if you are introducing a new ttf/woff font, don't forget to declare the font itself in the css file; here's one of the default fonts from `ui.css`:

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: 'scp';
	font-display: swap;
	src: local('Source Code Pro Regular'), local('SourceCodePro-Regular'), url(deps/scp.woff2) format('woff2');
}
```

and because textboxes don't inherit fonts by default, you can force it like this:

```css
input[type=text], input[type=submit], input[type=button] { font-family: var(--font-main) }
```

and if you want to have a monospace font in the fancy markdown editor, do this:

```css
.EasyMDEContainer .CodeMirror { font-family: var(--font-mono) }
```

NB: `<textarea id="mt">` and `<div id="mtr">` in the regular markdown editor must have the same font; none of the suggestions above will cause any issues but keep it in mind if you're getting creative


# `<head>`

to add stuff to the html `<head>`, for example a css `<link>` or `<meta>` tags, use either the global-option `--html-head` or the volflag `html_head`

if you give it the value `@ASDF` it will try to open a file named ASDF and send the text within

if the value starts with `%` it will assume a jinja2 template and expand it; the template has access to the `HttpCli` object through a property named `this` as well as everything in `j2a` and the stuff added by `self.j2s`; see [browser.html](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/copyparty/web/browser.html) for inspiration or look under the hood in [httpcli.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/copyparty/httpcli.py)


# translations

add your own translations by using the english or norwegian one from `browser.js` as a template

the easy way is to open up and modify `browser.js` in your own installation; depending on how you installed copyparty it might be named `browser.js.gz` instead, in which case just decompress it, restart copyparty, and start editing it anyways

you will be delighted to see inline html in the translation strings; to help prevent syntax errors, there is [a very jank linux script](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/scripts/tlcheck.sh) which is slightly better than nothing -- just beware the false-positives, so even if it complains it's not necessarily wrong/bad

if you're running `copyparty-sfx.py` then you'll find it at `/tmp/pe-copyparty.1000/copyparty/web` (on linux) or `%TEMP%\pe-copyparty\copyparty\web` (on windows)
* make sure to keep backups of your work religiously! since that location is volatile af


## translations (docker-friendly)

if editing `browser.js` is inconvenient in your setup, for example if you're running in docker, then you can instead do this:
* if you have python, go to the `scripts` folder and run `./tl.py fra Fran√ßais` to generate a `tl.js` which is perfect for translating to French, using the three-letter language code `fra`
  * if you do not have python, you can also just grab `tl.js` from the scripts folder, but I'll probably forget to keep that up to date... and then you'll have to find/replace all `"eng"` and `Ls.eng` to your three-letter language code
* put your `tl.js` inside a folder that is being shared by your copyparty, preferably the webroot
* run copyparty with the argument `--html-head='<script src="/tl.js"></script>'`
  * if you placed `tl.js` in the webroot then you're all good, but if you put it somewhere else then change `/tl.js` accordingly
  * if you are running copyparty with config files, you can do this:
    ```yaml
	[global]
	  html-head: <script src="/tl.js"></script>
	```

you can now edit `tl.js` and press CTRL-SHIFT-R in the browser to see your changes take effect as you go

if you want to contribute your translation back to the project (please do!) then you'll want to...
* grab all of the text inside your `var tl_cpanel = {` and add it to the translations inside `copyparty/web/splash.js` in the repo
* and the text inside your `var tl_browser = {` and add that to the translations inside `copyparty/web/browser.js` in the repo
