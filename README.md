# â‡†ðŸŽ‰ copyparty

* http file sharing hub (py2/py3) [(on PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/copyparty/)
* MIT-Licensed, 2019-05-26, ed @ irc.rizon.net


## summary

turn your phone or raspi into a portable file server with resumable uploads/downloads using IE6 or any other browser

* server runs on anything with `py2.7` or `py3.2+`
* *resumable* uploads need `firefox 12+` / `chrome 6+` / `safari 6+` / `IE 10+`
* code standard: `black`


## notes

* iPhone/iPad: use Firefox to download files
* Android-Chrome: set max "parallel uploads" for 200% upload speed (android bug)
* Android-Firefox: takes a while to select files (in order to avoid the above android-chrome issue)
* Desktop-Firefox: may use gigabytes of RAM if your connection is great and your files are massive
* paper-printing is affected by dark/light-mode! use lightmode for color, darkmode for grayscale
  * because no browsers currently implement the media-query to do this properly orz


## status

* [x] sanic multipart parser
* [x] load balancer (multiprocessing)
* [x] upload (plain multipart, ie6 support)
* [x] upload (js, resumable, multithreaded)
* [x] download
* [x] browser
* [x] media player
* [ ] thumbnails
* [ ] download as zip
* [x] volumes
* [x] accounts
* [x] markdown viewer
* [x] markdown editor
* [x] FUSE client (read-only)

summary: it works! you can use it! (but technically not even close to beta)


# client examples

* javascript: dump some state into a file (two separate examples)
  * `await fetch('https://127.0.0.1:3923/', {method:"PUT", body: JSON.stringify(foo)});`
  * `var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('POST', 'https://127.0.0.1:3923/msgs?raw'); xhr.send('foo');`

* FUSE: mount a copyparty server as a local filesystem
  * cross-platform python client available in [./bin/](bin/)
  * [rclone](https://rclone.org/) as client can give ~5x performance, see [./docs/rclone.md](docs/rclone.md)


# dependencies

* `jinja2`
  * pulls in `markupsafe` as of v2.7; use jinja 2.6 on py3.2

optional, enables thumbnails:
* `Pillow` (requires py2.7 or py3.5+)


# sfx

currently there are two self-contained binaries:
* `copyparty-sfx.sh` for unix (linux and osx) -- smaller, more robust
* `copyparty-sfx.py` for windows (unix too) -- crossplatform, beta

launch either of them (**use sfx.py on systemd**) and it'll unpack and run copyparty, assuming you have python installed of course

pls note that `copyparty-sfx.sh` will fail if you rename `copyparty-sfx.py` to `copyparty.py` and keep it in the same folder because `sys.path` is funky


## sfx repack

if you don't need all the features you can repack the sfx and save a bunch of space; all you need is an sfx and a copy of this repo (nothing else to download or build, except for either msys2 or WSL if you're on windows)
* `724K` original size as of v0.4.0
* `256K` after `./scripts/make-sfx.sh re no-ogv`
* `164K` after `./scripts/make-sfx.sh re no-ogv no-cm`

the features you can opt to drop are
* `ogv`.js, the opus/vorbis decoder which is needed by apple devices to play foss audio files
* `cm`/easymde, the "fancy" markdown editor

for the `re`pack to work, first run one of the sfx'es once to unpack it

**note:** you can also just download and run [scripts/copyparty-repack.sh](scripts/copyparty-repack.sh) -- this will grab the latest copyparty release from github and do a `no-ogv no-cm` repack; works on linux/macos (and windows with msys2 or WSL)


# install on android

install [Termux](https://termux.com/) (see [ocv.me/termux](https://ocv.me/termux/)) and then copy-paste this into Termux (long-tap) all at once:
```sh
apt update && apt -y full-upgrade && termux-setup-storage && apt -y install python && python -m ensurepip && python -m pip install -U copyparty
echo $?
```

after the initial setup, you can launch copyparty at any time by running `copyparty` anywhere in Termux


# dev env setup

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install jinja2  # mandatory deps
pip install Pillow  # thumbnail deps
pip install black bandit pylint flake8  # vscode tooling
```


# how to release

in the `scripts` folder:

* run `make -C deps-docker` to build all dependencies
* create github release with `make-tgz-release.sh`
* upload to pypi with `make-pypi-release.(sh|bat)`
* create sfx with `make-sfx.sh`


# todo

roughly sorted by priority

* up2k handle filename too long
* up2k fails on empty files? alert then stuck
* drop onto folders
* look into android thumbnail cache file format
* support pillow-simd
* cache sha512 chunks on client
* symlink existing files on upload
* comment field
* figure out the deal with pixel3a not being connectable as hotspot
  * pixel3a having unpredictable 3sec latency in general :||||
