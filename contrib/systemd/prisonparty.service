# this will start `/usr/local/bin/copyparty-sfx.py`
# in a chroot, preventing accidental access elsewhere
# and share '/mnt' with anonymous read+write
#
# installation:
#   1) put copyparty-sfx.py and prisonparty.sh in /usr/local/bin
#   2) cp -pv prisonparty.service /etc/systemd/system && systemctl enable --now prisonparty
#
# expose additional filesystem locations to copyparty
#   by listing them between the last `1000` and `--`
#
# `1000 1000` = what user to run copyparty as
#
# you may want to:
#   change '/mnt::rw' to another location or permission-set
#    (remember to change the '/mnt' chroot arg too)
#
# unless you add -q to disable logging, you may want to remove the
#   following line to allow buffering (slightly better performance):
#   Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
