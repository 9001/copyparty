# when running copyparty behind a reverse proxy,
# the following arguments are recommended:
#
#   --http-only     lower latency on initial connection
#   -i 127.0.0.1    only accept connections from nginx
#
# -nc must match or exceed the webserver's max number of concurrent clients;
# copyparty default is 1024 if OS permits it (see "max clients:" on startup),
# nginx default is 512  (worker_processes 1, worker_connections 512)
#
# you may also consider adding -j0 for CPU-intensive configurations
# (not that i can really think of any good examples)
